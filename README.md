# `dirs`

## Introduction

- a tiny low-level library with a minimal API
- that provides the platform-specific, user-accessible locations
- for retrieving and storing configuration, cache and other data
- on Linux, Windows (â‰¥ Vista), macOS and other platforms.

The library provides the location of these directories by leveraging the mechanisms defined by

- the [XDG base directory](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and
  the [XDG user directory](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/) specifications on Linux
- the [Known Folder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378457.aspx) API on Windows
- the [Standard Directories](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW6)
  guidelines on macOS

## Platforms

This library is written in Go, and supports Linux, macOS and Windows.
Other platforms are also supported; they use the XDG conventions.

It's mid-level sister library, _directories_, is available for Rust ([directories-rs](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs))
and on the JVM ([directories-jvm](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-jvm)).

## TODO

- Add XDG directory code
